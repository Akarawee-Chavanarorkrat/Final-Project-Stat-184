# How do you quantify the Wine Score
The data came from the Wine Mag(Wine Enthusiast) containing over 130k Data set. All the wine in this data set has been tested, rate, and critics by the top critics in the industry.
## Goal of this Project
To quantify the score of the wine without tasting the wine itself. Personally I'm a wine connoisseur and I do collect wine as a hobby. Drinking every wine before making an investment is impossible because some of the high quality wine can be very expensive. I have come up with a 3 stage plan to quantify the wine from this dataset.
### Price and Score
To start off wine score ranges from 80 to 100 not 0-100 as people might think

According to the Wine Mag website(winemag.com) 
#### Acceptable 80-82: Can be employed in casual, less-critical circumstances.
#### Good 83-86: Suitable for everyday consumption; often good value.
#### Very good 87-89: Often good value; well recommended.
#### Excellent 90-93: Highly recommended.
#### Superb 94-97: A great achievement.
#### Classic 98-100: The pinnacle of quality.

Price and Score does have a correlation. The data shows a positive correlation between price and score but this is not a sure answer because some very bad wine can be very expensive and some good wine can be very affordable.

With some further research Wine Mag explain the testing method. All the wine were tested blind which mean the critics will not know the price nor the winery until after the drink this will ensure that no bias can occur.

### Finding what is the reason for the score in the data.
Since the price isn't the direct correlation of the score I look elsewhere in to the description of the wine. This is the given impression of the wine from the critics.
### Finding the sample.
I put out the data into 2 group the bad(bottom 5 percent) and the great(top 5 percent) these 2 are the 2 spectrum of wine 1 being in the 80-86 which is acceptable to good and the other 93-100 excellent to classic. The different between the 2 are so varse that my hypothesis suggest that there will be some big difference in some area.

### The Description
The description of the wine are very similar in a lot of ways as a matter of a fact up to 70 percent of the word use in the bottom wine can be found on the top wine. But, some word such as develop, refined, perfect, delicius, elegance is a tell tell sign of top wine due to the ratio of word appearance
